# HTTP Proxy Mode

HTTP Proxy Mode is a minimal proxy server which wraps the [Scrapingpass HTTP API](/getting-started/scrapingpass-api#http-rest-api) for you so that you can incorporate our API into your project by just adding this proxy to your request methods rather than modifying your codebase heavily and rewrite them incorporating Scrapingpass API.
