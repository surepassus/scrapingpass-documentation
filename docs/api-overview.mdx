## Example API Usage

Scrapingpass API can be easily integrated into your new or existing project. As of now, Scrapingpass provides two interfaces to integrate and consume the API. Depending on your project setup, you may use either of these.

- ## HTTP REST API

Scrapingpass provides really simple HTTP REST API without multiple confusing endpoints. A single endpoint for all your scraping needs. Each behaviour of parsing and response can be modified by passing options as query parameters.

- ## HTTP Proxy Mode

HTTP Proxy Mode is the most intuitive way to consume the API without making too much changes to your existing project. It can be incorporated into your ecosystem by simply injecting our proxy into your request methods. That's it. Scrapingpass will automatically do the rest for you.

Options and other stuffs like your API key is needed to be configured in this proxy URL as HTTP basic authorization in form of proxy's username and password.
